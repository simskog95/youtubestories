      <p>Neistat started to post daily vlogs on YouTube on March 24, 2015. On his May 15, 2015, vlog post "The Vice President, Outer Space and the Baby," Neistat stated that he sees his vlogs more as a forum as opposed to a daily journal. On January 19, 2016 Neistat posted his 300th vlog. As a result of vlogging everyday, Neistat said he has chosen to refrain from making any feature length content. Neistat is frequently seen using and discussing his collection of Boosted boards in his daily vlogs, which are sometimes showcased in his other YouTube videos.</p>
	  <p>On January 23, 2016, during the January 2016 United States blizzard, which caused travel bans in New York City, Neistat, his brother Dean, Oscar Boyson, and Jesse Wellens filmed a video through the empty streets of New York City. The 2-minute, 41-second video, titled "Snowboarding with the NYPD," showed Neistat being towed on a rope on the streets and through Times Square, after which a police officer pardons him. The video went viral, and gained 6.5 million views on YouTube within 24 hours.</p>

	  <p>On September 8, 2016, Neistat won GQ's "New Media Star" Man of the Year Award.</p>

	  <p>On September 19, 2016, Neistat published a vlog titled "The $21,000 first class airplane seat", in which he experiences Emirates' first class service, featuring amenities such as touchscreen monitors, a personal beverage compartment, and a shower available to guests. The video quickly gained media attention and is currently the most viewed video on Neistat's channel, as of January 22, 2017, with over 30.5 million views.</p>

	  <p>As of November 10, 2016, Neistat has released 710 vlogs and other films on his YouTube channel since its creation on February 15, 2010. The subject matter of the films varies greatly, and most feature Neistat. On August 22, 2015, Neistat reached 1 million subscribers which increased to 4 million by August 2016, 5 million by October 2016, and 5.6 million by November 2016.</p>

      <p>On November 19, 2016, Neistat announced that he was cancelling his vlog permanently to focus more on short-films, which he plans uploading to YouTube in place of his daily vlogs on a regular basis.</p>

          <p class="bildtext">JON OLSSON</p>
      <p>Skier, blogger, car-enthusiast, product designer; Jon Olsson lives his life to extremes.</p>

	  <p>Born in Mora, Sweden, Jon’s affinity for skiing from an early age was a precursor to so much more. After racing in his early years, he eventually traded speed for spring at the age of 16 and switched to freestyle skiing. Jon would go on to play a key role in defining the budding sport with influential video segments and competitive dominance as well as inventing a handful of double flips, all characterized by his distinguished style. Just under a decade later Jon would pick back up the race skis as a result of a bet with fellow alpine skier Jens Byggmark.</p>

	  <p>After four years of balancing both Alpine World Cups and freestyle events — including his own Jon Olsson Invitational, now in its 11th annual iteration — Jon is focusing his efforts back on freestyle skiing. With nine X Games medals, more than ten film appearances and countless other freeski accolades under his belt, his sights are set on progressing the sport and enjoying the hell out of every step along the way.</p>

	  <p>Jon’s passion is infectious. His innovations in freeskiing have spurred industry wide trends in tricks and his automotive designs can be found imitated around the world. A trendsetter in the world of apparel, Jon’s history of product design culminates in his most recent projects, namely the highly successful Douchebags travel gear — co-founded by Jon alongside Truls Brataas.</p>

	  <p>Jon now resides in Monaco, playing as hard as he works and shares every step of the way through social media and his blog. He currently drives an array of Audis, including his uniquely customized RS6, and designed his own super car, the Rebellion R2K, which he drives in the Gumball 3000 each year.</p>

	  <p>Jon’s life is all about snow, fun and friends and you can follow it all day-to-day here on his blog and in his video blog!</p>
